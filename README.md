# IF-Game-Templates

This is a collection of files and classes that can be used to make
a classic text adventure game like those available in the 1980's.
(Today they call it "parser-based interactive fiction.")

Commands in the game are simple VERB NOUN combinations. That's as
complicated as I plan to make things for now. There are whole
languages (such as Inform and TADS) devoted to the creation of
parser-based IF in the event you really want to easily create a
game with more functionality. If you're serious about IF, give
them a look.

Those familiar with the languages above may notice some similarities
between my choices of how to handle data and those used in TADS.
I freely admit TADS was a big influence on my Python templates,
though of course I had to add some twists of my own. Recreating
TADS functionality would be far, far more work than I planned to do.

So, I hope you enjoy these templates. Feel free to experiment with
them and see what you can create!
